# This is a coding trial program!

This program was written as a way to gadge my skills in software development. This isn't a fully backend delivery program but a part of it. Feel free to clone, fork, edit and run this program however you wish.


## Requirements

* Visual Studio 2022
* ASP .NET Core Runtime 8
* .NET SDK & Runtime 8

## Build Program

With .NET installed, you can run the **build_rs.bat** for a Release build or **build_ds.bat** for a Debug build. The builds will be created in a folder inside the project file as **Builds/Release** and **Builds/Debug** respectively.
You can also run debug builds in Visual Studio. In the IDE, you will also get the Swagger API debug page as well (This can also be ran in the builds as well but just removing/changing an if statement in **Program.cs**).

## Don't forget!

If you are going to use this program openly, **please go to the programs appsettings.json and change the secret keys!**
