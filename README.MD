# This is a coding trial program!

This program was written to gauge my skills in software development. It isn't a fully working backend delivery program. It is only a part of it. Feel free to clone, fork, edit, and run this program however you wish.


## Requirements

* Visual Studio 2022
* ASP .NET Core Runtime 8
* .NET SDK & Runtime 8

## Build Program

With .NET installed, you can run the **build_rs.bat** for a Release build or **build_ds.bat** for a Debug build. The builds will be created in a folder inside the project file as **Builds/Release** and **Builds/Debug** respectively.
You can also run debug builds in Visual Studio. In the IDE, you will also get the Swagger API debug page. (This can also be run in the builds by just removing/changing an if statement in **Program.cs**.)

## Don't forget!

If you are going to use this program openly, **please go to the program's appsettings.json and change the secret keys!**
